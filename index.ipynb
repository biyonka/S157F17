    "\n",
    "+ All code readable, documented adequately, accompanied by unit tests with high (>98%) coverage, and made available in GitHub\n",
    "+ Presentation _source_ should be LaTeX or Markdown or Jupyter or another open format (not, e.g., Powerpoint)\n",
    "+ Paper should be written in LaTeX or Markdown or another open format (not, e.g., Word)\n",
    "+ Presentations should be about 30 minutes, plus time for questions. Everyone on each team should say _something_ during the presentation (to get some practice with public speaking), but it's fine to have one or two people do most of the talking. \n",
    "+ Written reports should be in the form of a paper, including an abstract, introduction, a brief literature review, methods, results, open questions or next steps, links to code and data, and an appropriate bibliography. There is no length requirement for the report.\n",
    "+ At the end of the report, in an \"Acknowledgments\" section, please include a few sentences describing each team member's contributions to the work."
